## Introduction

Hello! My name is Rishabh Lal, [rishblol](https://github.com/Rishblol) on Github and as you know by now, I love developing anything concerning the Internet.
My journey started in 6th grade, when we were learning [QBASIC](https://www.qbasic.net/) and just seeing that unique, rustic UI of it (even though it wasn't a lot), I just fell in love with it.
Fast forward to 10th grade, I started learning Java and was introduced to Object Oriented Programming concepts, something which did take time to learn and get used to, coming from languages like Visual BASIC and C.\
Then in 11-12th I was introduced to python and loved it the second I started learning it. During 12th grade my friends and I created a Flask app which was a stocks handling website. It was a great learning curve but we enjoyed making that. Prior to that we'd made a app using Streamlit for data analysis.
In college, my friends and I made a project using frameworks such as Next.js to create a website where we showcased car models and could customize it.

Now for the main question- why the website?

## Website makes my day
I did have this fantasy of having my own website and could talk/yap on any topic (technical/non-technical) and have full freedom on what I could do with the website, in terms of styling and user experience. I was even more motivated when my friend [Nikhil](https://heftymouse.me/) had told me that he had a website for a while now and my other friend [Adithya](https://adithyanair.com/) had recently made his own website.\
Then they had this idea of creating a webring, and created [this website](https://amrita.town/) where everyone from our college could show their websites and people would appreciate each and everyone's unique style of designing.\
My main problem was the domain part- whether I need to invest in one for the purposes or push it for later.
But me, being me, forgot that github pages existed for a reason- and that was all the motivation I needed to make this website.


## Actually building the website
Full steam ahead! Anyways, now that I had all the things set and ready to go, the main part was how the website should look and feel.\
I wanted it as clean and clutter-free as possible.\
I did see some sites which had amazing designs and looked very professional, but then my purpose was not the design, but to connect and have many people look and read my blogs/projects have a few people appreciate the simplicity of it.

## Conclusion
And so here we are, with a basic but very clean looking website. I hope this inspires you to also make websites with the same love and commitment as I did when making this. Ciao! ü§ç
