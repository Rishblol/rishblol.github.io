## Introduction

Hello! My name is Rishabh Lal, [rishblol](https://github.com/Rishblol) on Github and as you know by now, I love developing anything concerning the Internet.
My journey started in 6th grade, when we were learning [QBASIC](https://www.qbasic.net/) and just seeing that unique, rustic UI of it (even though it wasn't a lot), I just fell in love with it.
Fast forward to 10th grade, I started learning Java and was introduced to Object Oriented Programming concepts, something which did take time to learn and get used to, coming from languages like Visual BASIC and C.\
Then in 11-12th I was introduced to python and loved it the second I started learning it. During 12th grade my friends and I created a Flask app which was a stocks handling website. It was a great learning curve but we enjoyed making that. Prior to that we'd made a app using Streamlit for data analysis.
In college, my friends and I made a project using frameworks such as Next.js to create a website where we showcased car models and could customize it.

Now for the main question- why the website?

# keeping up with the credentials

## Question

I'm all about strong passwords. If you're not using one, you're just playing yourself.

This challenge requires something that can be acquired in any of the other web challenges.

## Solution

Here we've been given with a website looking like this.

Since we obtained the credentials of `admin:9f3IC3uj9^zZ` from @[breaking authentication](mention://575ed52d-d831-46b9-a70b-afad2ee03550/document/7bf4b60e-7a20-4606-9aa5-b092e8c12ebf) challenge, we try to login and we get to a debug page, which is not that useful.

Now usually when we login it's a `GET` request

Let's just try changing that to a POST request, and it'll send a `302 found` of `/admin.php` and going to `/admin.php` we get the flag.
